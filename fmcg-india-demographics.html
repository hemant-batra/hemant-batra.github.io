      <h2>How FMCG companies can utilize the changing Indian demographics</h2>
      <h4><span style="color: #800000;">Emerging demographic &amp; economic trends</span></h4>
      <ol>
         <li><span style="color: #0000ff;">A significant shift of population density from urban to rural settlements.</span><br />A bulk of the workforce that had migrated from rural areas and smaller towns of India to urban centres for employment reasons is now reverse migrating back to the suburbs due to loss of employment that has been brought upon them by the pandemic. This is leading to a change in population densities of both urban and rural areas. As per Facebook data, the rural population has increased by 7% while urban settlements lost between 4% and 11% according to their typology &ndash; from metropolis to small census towns.</li>
         <li><span style="color: #0000ff;">Households adopting a frugal lifestyle while still holding significant purchasing power.</span><br />Unemployment has resulted in a drastic decrease in the amount of disposable income of households both in urban &amp; rural areas and thus consumers are limiting themselves to frugality i.e. either downgrading to more affordable offerings or shifting towards value-for-money large packs. Although this does not mean that Indian households are completely cash deprived. There is a healthy monetary reserve built up over the past years due to remittance income from the migrant population. Also, with the government providing support under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), unemployment levels are reducing in the rural regions. Plus, with a lot of companies providing work from home employment continuity for their employees, cash depravity is no longer a major concern for several regions of rural India. Although there still are vast areas of the rural segment which still in depravity.</li>
         <li><span style="color: #0000ff;">A steep rise in e-tailing and digital payments in rural regions.</span><br />An increasing number of consumers are moving to the e-commerce model of retailing (e-tailing) due to improved internet penetration, increased computer literacy and the need to avoid going to physical markets as a safety measure against the pandemic. The rise in e-tailing has given a boost to the cashless economy wherein digital payments, once a convenience, have become a necessity in these times. This, combined with the increased use of online social media by the rural population has made digital advertising an attractive option for FMCG companies.</li>
      </ol>
      <h4><span style="color: #800000;">Supply Chain, Advertising and New Product development strategies to be adopted by FMCG companies</span></h4>
      <ol>
         <li>
            There has been a boom in the sales of private labels not only because of their lower price points but also because consumers were forced to try them as their preferred brands were sold out due to hoarding by other consumers and were not replenished due to affected supply chains. FMCG companies not only need to strengthen their presence in the rural market but also need to compete with private labels. Some of the measures that FMCG companies need to take are:<br />
            <ul>
               <li>Transform the rural distribution networks to cater to the demand surge by engaging with aggregators and rural distribution companies at the district level. This will help reduce transaction period and cost, with increased direct coverage at the village level. They should also increase linkages with stockists and sub-stockists.</li>
               <li>Initiate van based mobile retail outlets which can be quickly replenished with supplies as and when needed. This will not only increase the area covered but also save on cost and time which is needed to open multiple fixed retail outlets.</li>
               <li>Form tie-ups with essential products distribution services like Swiggy, Zomato, Grofers, BigBasket and Dunzo to strengthen last-mile deliveries within the comfort of consumers' homes.</li>
               <li>List online or co-create products with e-commerce players like Flipkart &amp; Amazon and launch online first products.</li>
            </ul>
         </li>
         <li>FMCG companies should focus more on the development of immunity-boosting products or hygiene products such as soaps, sanitisers, face masks etc to capitalize on the surge in demand for them as a result of the pandemic. There is also a demand surge for reading to eat meal items. Many of these products like soaps and sanitisers can be launched in low-cost small packs or sachets to attract the not-so-rich rural consumers who need these products in the pandemic but cannot afford to buy in large quantities. National level FMCG players can capitalize on the fact that there seems to be a shift among the consumers from loose and unbranded to trusting affordable brands. The new product development cycles of FMCG companies should be modified to be agile to make the product turnover time shorter compressing the stages of idea generation &amp; screening, concept development &amp; testing, strategy development, business analysis, product development, test marketing and commercialization to just strategy, development, marketing and commercialization.</li>
         <li>
            The following advertising strategies can be employed to target rural consumers:<br />
            <ul>
               <li>Introduce loyalty programs along with advertisements in rural mass media.</li>
               <li>Invest in digital marketing targeted at rural consumers.</li>
               <li>Partner with organisations that connect to the masses, like The Indian Railways, to promote hygiene and provide sanitisers, disinfectant sprays etc thus simultaneously advertising for the products.</li>
               <li>Connect to rural areas and engage with people communicating about their brand's environmental and sustainability efforts, community initiatives, health impact and value addition.</li>
               <li>Train local village people for door-to-door advertising and sales for products.</li>
               <li>For remote areas with limited electricity and little access to mass media, brands can use the missed call advertising wherein a missed call from a consumer triggers an automatic callback with a promotion message about a product.</li>
            </ul>
         </li>
      </ol>
      <p>With increasing work from home opportunities and a growing rural economy, the likelihood of the rural workforce leaving for urban areas post Covid-19 is not very high. Thus, with a rising rural consumer base, FMCG companies can plan for the future to have a permanent presence at tier-2 and ties-3 cities.</p>
